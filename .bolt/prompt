For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

#First Rule : Don't change the UI, basically Don't change complete UI in animated-ai-chat.tsx . Preserve the main UI components 

#Don't change other functionalities except the one asked to do so. Let the other functionalities remain intact.
